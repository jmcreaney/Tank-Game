# Tank-Game

Tank game is a compiled C++ program created with Dev C++ Win32 APIs.  You will need to download the gamedata.pkg the tnk tur and spg text files that contian game data.

This is a proto game with the basic sequence of play and tanks included.  My page for this game is:

I have a feedback link or enki034@yahoo.com

I would like some feedback and if there is interest in contributing to the concept.  I wrote everything to include the graphics
and graphics objects.  Things this game needs is an AI player and real map.  Adding in more kinds of untis would be good as well.  

More to come...
